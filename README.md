# jiffytbx
A repository for my own jiffy code - things in here should be _useful_
illustrations of how to use DIALS (as a toolbox) but may not meet the
standards necessary for direct inclusion in DIALS itself -

- the test overage may be poor
- the functions may not have 100% universal application
- the documentation is likely to be sub-standard

However it should give the reader an idea of how to do things for
themselves.
